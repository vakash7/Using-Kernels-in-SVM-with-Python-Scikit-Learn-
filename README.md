# Using-Kernels-in-SVM-with-Python-Scikit-Learn-
This project demonstrates how Support Vector Machines (SVMs) use different kernels to handle non-linearly separable data. By applying the Kernel Trick, SVMs can map data into a higher-dimensional space where it becomes separable.

The implementation includes:
-->Generating non-linearly separable data using make_moons()
-->Training SVM models with different kernels:
 1)Linear Kernel
 2)Polynomial Kernel
 3)Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel
  -->Visualizing decision boundaries of each kernel
  -->Evaluating model accuracy
